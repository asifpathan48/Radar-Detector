# Radar Detector with Servo and Real-time Visualization

This project combines an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and Processing software for real-time object detection with visual feedback. The radar detector system detects obstacles and displays a red color when an obstacle is detected, and green when no obstacle is present. It is Arduino Uno compatible and suitable for obstacle sensing and security applications.
